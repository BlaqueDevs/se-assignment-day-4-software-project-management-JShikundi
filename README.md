Evolving; scope can be adjusted throughout	
High; continuous feedback is encouraged	
Frequent releases 
Continuous testing throughout development	
Risks are managed early due to iterative approach
Minimal documentation; emphasis on working software	

Waterfall:
Linear & Sequential
Rigid; changes are costly and difficult
Defined upfront, with limited flexibility
Low; feedback is typically given at the end
Single final delivery at the end of the project
Testing happens after development is complete
Risks are identified late in the process
Extensive documentation required upfront

Agile Methodology
Advantages:
>Faster time-to-market with incremental releases
>High flexibility to accommodate changing requirements
>Better customer collaboration and satisfaction
>Improved risk management through continuous feedback
Disadvantages:
>Less predictable costs and timelines
